7. Crawling and Querying Social Networks
Description: In this project, we will crawl social network data (e.g., Twitter), store them
in a graph database, conduct queries (e.g., spatial-temporal, keyword, sentimental queries)
on social networks, and visualize social networks and query results.

Requirements: Internet programming (e.g., C++, C#, Java, Python, etc.), database design,
algorithm design

Notes from 24 Jan 2018 meeting:
-----------------------------------
IDEA: 
Replies to the subreddit r/TIL threads with a comment w/brief summary and link to our website that will provide more information, 
analytics, twitter information, etc. in an easily digestible and helpful manner.

PRIMARY INPUT: 
-Reddit r/TIL subreddit threads
-Will establish a criteria of which posts to generate content for (ex: >100 karma, x amount of comments, etc.)

WEBSITE:
-Info on the topic found from Wikipedia (and other sources) found automatically
-Twitter/tweets about the topic, analytics, etc.
-Reddit populartiy of the thread (does the general consensus agree with the TIL content and validity? Tone analysis, Watson, etc.)
-Top reddit comments from thread (if they have a high amount of karma)
-Infographics, word clouds (from comments in thread, etc.)

TOOLS NEEDED:
-Database (SQL, JSON, PHP, JavaScript)
-Python for analysis
-Tool to determine topic of r/TIL post (TextBlob)
-Website Programming (JavaScript, HTML, CSS, etc.)

OTHER:
-WikiPedia API
-Other News Sources
-TL;DR reddit bot

-----------------------------------
Project Ideas:
-----------------------------------

1. scrape twitter/pastebin/reddit to perform analytics on data. perhaps commonly used words in given tasks/locations
2. Reddit bot that queries the top comments on a reddit thread, goes to Imgur (maybe Twitter instead?) and finds a meme/picture (from Imgur) or 
   a tweet with similar keywords (maybe have it look at only certain Twitter accounts for material?)
